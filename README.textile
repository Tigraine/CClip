h1. CClip

CClip takes all input and puts it in the clipboard. 
So you can pipe stuff from the commandline to clip and then paste it to whatever window you want.

Really handy if you need to copy file contents around:

@cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | cclip@

h2. Installation 

Put cclip.exe in your path somewhere
